			<div class="description">
				<ul>
					<li>Particles cause vertex displacement on a plane at the location of impact.</li>
					<li>Rain drops are managed by a GLSL compute shader using simplex noise to generate start locations
						on a
						plane above the water surface.</li>
					<li>Drops are animated using a gravity force which nicely allows for directional rain. Drops are
						loop preload="metadata" controlsed as they intersect with the ground. Intersection locations are output to a separate
						texture of 'puddle points'.</li>
					<li>Puddle points are used to instance circles viewed above with an orthogonal camera and output to
						a new render target.</li>
					<li>A heightmap is drawn using video feedback, edge detection, and Catmull-Rom blurring to create
						rippling effects from the rendered circles.</li>
					<li>A modified PBR material shader displaces the water surface using the heightmap.</li>
					<li>Normal, environment, metallic, and roughness maps are applied to complete the water-like look.
					</li>

			<div class="description">
				<p>A green-screened performer mimics playful interaction in an underwater world.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fish are modelled in Blender, their tails animate using a vertex shader and a combination of
						high and low frequency sine waves to approximate swimming motions.</li>
					<li>Plants are alembics with pulsing vertex animation to add more life and character. Bubbles are
						mesh-instanced particle systems with upward force and turbulence.</li>
					<li>Post effects include colour grading, uv displacement, GLSL god rays, and projected noise
						textures that simulate caustics.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Three audio stems (guitar, bass, drums) are visualised as colourful audio-reactive trees in a
						forest.
					</li>
					<li>
						Audio data is resampled to 30hz. Amplitude is used for positioning in one dimension to instance
						small hexagonal geometry. A wave is multiplied along the sampling window to scale down amplitude
						at each end of the tree.
					</li>
					<li>
						Screen-space reflections are used on the ground plane to add depth and polish to the scene.

			<h2 class="video-title">Dolphin Swim Animation Shader &amp; Boids Simulation</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>A cheap and easy dolphin swimming animation. A sine wave is applied along the length (z-axis) of the
					mesh driven by time to move vertices. Fins are animated by scaling a rotation by the vertex x-axis
					values. This moves the tips of the fins most and the body the least. Animation is offset by instance
					ID. Built on a GPU Boids simulation by <a href="https://dirt.design/portfolio/touchdesigner-boids/

			<h2 class="video-title">Alien Garden Envrionment</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<ul>
					<li>The ground transitions from a flat black plane to pink rolling hills using animated heightmaps, creating fluid transitions between different worlds.</li>
					<li>Grass geometry is instanced then animated with a simple bend. The amount of rotation applied to a vertex is dependent on its height. Similar animations are applied to the other plants.</li>
					<li>An alembic tree grows along a curve. The underside of its geometry is sprinkled with positions to instance flat shaded fruit, blowing in the wind using generative rotation.</li>
					<li>Motes of dust float about the scene. These are instanced low-poly spheres drawn to a render target, blurred, then composite over the scene.</li>

			<h2 class="video-title">Jellyfish Vertex Groups</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>Procedurally modelled jellyfish. A sphere mesh is trimmed to 75&percnt; size. Six cylinders are shaped into cones. Vertex attributes are added to the separate pieces to later identify them in the vertex shader. The shader then applies pulse and wiggle animations to specific pieces at varying frequencies to create a dynamic smack of jellyfish.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Particles, Forces, and Audio-Reactivity</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>A particle system is influenced by a rotating force around the performer to create an upward swirling effect. Particles scale based on the power of the drum sounds. This adds a connection between the remaining sounds and elements as the performance draws to a close.
				</p>
				<p>Volumetric fog and light rays are added as post effects to give depth to the scene. Swirling green clouds are composite with post effects to simulate mild aurora and colour the glow around the sun.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Generative Paths</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>The birds and camera in this scene follow the same path however, they are randomly offset from each other using generative noise. The travel speed of the camera and birds are also randomly adjusted over to give the impression of a more 'human' camera operator, simulating a behaviour commonly seen in this type of footage.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Video Caching &amp; Texture Instancing</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>Video frames are streamed into a 3D texture, each layer within the texture is then instanced closely in a line to create a visually interesting 3D twist on video feedback that many are familiar with.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Foot Tracking &amp; Depth Correction</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>To apply 2D chroma-keyed footage to a 3D world convincingly, the performer's feet had to be detected and effectively clamped to the ground plane. The performer would otherwise float above the ground when stepping backwards.</p>
				<p>This is achieved by first detecting the lowest non-transparent pixel in the feed. The performer is rendered to a rectangle in a separate scene. By shooting a ray at the UV of the lowest point, the closest intersection along the ray to the ground in front or behind the performer can be found. Moving the performer to this location (with some scaling) creates a convincing effect of grounding the character in the final scene.

			<h2 class="video-title">Character Creation &amp; Animation Workflow</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>Members of the band '<a href="https://bisnation.com/" target="_blank">bis</a>' were scanned using the In3D app to provide an approximation of their likeness for this video. Scans were tidied up in Blender. Finer details, clothing, and accessories were added, including textures developed in Photoshop. Each model was exported with a baked texture atlas for ease of use in TouchDesigner. Models were then auto-rigged with Mixamo and put back into Blender for fine tuning. Using a Mixamo rig later made it very easy to hot swap animations during development. This workflow allowed me to test animations in context to make creative decisions quickly.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Skinned Animation Textures</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>This scene shows many varying skinned animations. The achieve this with instancing a python script recorded the bone matrices for each frame of the animation from an FBX. Matrices were then written to a texture and passed as a uniform to a vertex shader. The bone matrix values could then be read in any order to offset/speed/slow the animation depending on the instance. Several animations could also be used efficiently by one shader in one render call.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Camera Effects</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>Depth of field is applied as a post process using the depth buffer and a blur. The amount of blur is scaled by the depth of the scene. This allows narrative elements to be brought in and out of focus.</p>
				<p>Similarly, the 'Lucky Night' sign is rendered separately, blurred, and composite over to create a glowing effect. A purple light is placed nearby to approximate the illumination the sign would provide to characters and surroundings in lieu of real emissive lighting in TouchDesigner.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">Instancing &amp; Video Feedback</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>This scene made use of video feedback and instancing to create a variety of fun dance scenarios with these characters. The background uses random colours generated by simplex noise. These simple techniques allowed me to build interesting psychedelic scenes quickly.</p>

			<h2 class="video-title">90s Club Environment</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>The outer shell of the club environment was built in Blender. Interior details were added procedurally including lights, glasses, tables, chairs and bar taps. These were later textured with PBR materials. Cone lights were added outside to simulate those of a city street. Internal lights did not match up to models but instead provided a general atmosphere. A projected texture was used to emulate disco ball reflections.</p>
